# Classes, Inheritance, & Node Module Import/Export Practice Test

Time to practice creating and using classes, inheritance, and module 
importing/exporting!

Your objective is to implement the requirements listed in each file of the
`/problems` directory. In addition to the prompts available at the top of each
file, Mocha specs are provided to test your work.

To get started, use the following commands:

1. `cd` into the starter directory
2. `npm install` to install any dependencies
3. `mocha` to run the test cases

If you want to run the tests for one problem file at a time, you can do so 
with the following command in your terminal:
    `mocha test/test-01-make-dragons-spec.js`

*** Please note, in the instructions for Problems #2 and #3 you are required to 
export the classes you define. IF YOU DO NOT CORRECTLY EXPORT THE CLASS, THE 
MOCHA TESTS WILL THROW A 'TypeError` AND NOT RUN ***
