# Promises and Unit Tests Practice Test

Please treat this practice test like 2 seperate tests.  The practice problems 
on promises are completely seperate from the practice problems on testing.

There is a solution folder that will contain the solution code for both practice
test sections.

# Promises Section

Time to practice with promises!

Your objective is to implement the requirements listed in each file of the
`/promises` directory. In addition to the prompts available at the top of each
file, Mocha specs are provided to test your work.

To get started, use the following commands:

1. `npm install` to install any dependencies
2. `cd` into the `/promises` directory`
3. `mocha` to run the test cases

If you want to run the tests for one problem file at a time, you can do so 
with the following command in your terminal:
    `mocha test/test-01-fetch-promise-spec.js`

Please remember you will need to be in the `/promises` directory for this portion
of the practice, and it is not at all connected to the section on Unit Testing.


# Unit Testing Section

Your objective is to implement the requirements listed in each file of the
`/testing` directory. In addition to the prompts available at the top of each
file, Mocha specs are provided to test your work.

To get started, use the following commands:

1. `cd` into the `/testing` directory (you do NOT need to npm install again)
2. `mocha` to run the test cases

If you want to run the tests for one problem file at a time, you can do so 
with the following command in your terminal:
    `mocha test/03-test-driven--specs-reverse.js`

Please remember you will need to be in the `/testing` directory for this portion
of the practice, and it is not at all connected to the section on Promises.
