# VIDEO 1 - BROWSER AND BOM LECTURE

Document Object Model (DOM)
- interface that allows us to dynamically access and update the content, structure, and style of a website
- JavaScript is the client-side scripting language that connects to the DOM in an internet browser
- defines:
	- HTML elements as objects
	- properties and methods on those objects
	- events we can use to change our webpage
- tldr: DOM allows us to change, add, delete HTML content



Browser Object Model (BOM)
- larger representation of everything provided by the browser including the current document, location, history, frames, and any other functionality the browser may expose to JavaScript
- `window.open("https://www.google.com", "Google", "width=100, height=100")`
  - opens new window set to google



DOM VS BOM
- DOM: the API used to access the elements inside the document
- BOM: larger representation of everything provided by browser, includes document



Accessing Elements using the DOM
- we use the DOM to select elements on the page using HTML and CSS selectors
  - tagName: the element's tag name, i.e `h1` or `body`
	- class: attribute given to html elements as a way to group them together
	- id: unique attribute given to an element

The Browser Diagram:

1. User Interface
   - what users interact with
	 - address bar, back/forward buttons, bookmarks, etc.
	 - everything except page content

2. Browser Engine
	 - manages interactions between UI and rendering engine
	 - communicates user input to rendering engine 

3. Render Engine
	 - displays requested page content
	 - parses HTML and uses CSS to build render tree and display content
	 - constructs DOM (obj rep of document tree)
	 - not all browsers use same rendering engnie
	 	 - this is why things look different
		 - chrome (Blink), safari (Webkit)

4. Networking
	- sends network calls, i.e http requests to server
	- asks for images, docs, etc. that make up page

5. Javascript Interpreter
	 - parses and executes JS code (v8)

6. UI Backend
	 - used for drawing basic widgets like checkboxes, inputs, etc. 

7. Data Storage
	 - persistence of data in browser (i.e cookies, web storage)
	 - small database used to preserve state btwn refreshes
	 - cookies vs web storage
		 - Cookies can be read by the server as well as the client. 
		 - Web storage data can be read only client-side.
		 - more to come







# VIDEO 2 - REQUEST/RESPONSE CYCLE


Overview
- browsing web is series of req and res
- request: searching for info or navigating to page
  - file path in browser => GET request for file
	- navigating to webpage => GET request for webpage
- response: what we expect to receive from req

Request / Response Cycle Diagram

1. Client Side (browser)
	 - what user interacts with

2. Internet
	 - series of client req and server responses
	 - more on this to come

3. Server side 
	 - handles req and sends res
	 - more on this later



The role of the browser
- used to make req to server
	- can view req/res in Network Tab of Developer Tools
- parses HTML, CSS, JS
- renders info to user by constructing & rendering DOM tree



# VIDEO 3 - WINDOW OBJECT LECTURE


Window Object
- represents an open window in a browser
- the global object in the browser
- the root of the DOM
	- contains document property used to reference DOM 


Scripts overview
- browser loads HTML top down 
- if it comes accross script:
	- must wait until script downloads & executes before processing rest of page
	- scripts have longer processing time than html


Script placement issues
1. scripts cant see DOM els below thme so they cant add handlers
2. if bulky script is at top of page, it "blocks the page"
	 - users cant see page content till script runs


SOLUTIONS 
1. place script at bottom of page
	 - browser sees script only after full html doc is downloaded
	 - for long html docs, may be noticaeble delay
2. event listeners
   - wrap JS code in event listener for "DOMContentLoaded"
	 - code will execute when HTML has been parased (dom is loaded)
3. `window.onload`
	 - event fires when entire page has loaded including document, images, css files, etc.
	 - usually overkill, just need to wait for the document to load
4. `defer` attribute
   - delaying script execution until the HTML parser has finished (dom loaded)
	 - execute script when DOM is ready (before DOMContentLoaded event)
	 - only for external scripts (with src attrib)
	 - scripts still execute in "document order" (top down)
5. `async` attribute
	 - script will be executed as soon as itâ€™s ready
	 - blocks the DOM from loading
	 - use if script isn't dependent on DOM loading and want scripts to execute as soon as they have loaded
	 - async scripts dont wait for eachother
	 	 - small script will run before large even if placed after large
	 - "load first order" so don't use if order matters (scripts dependent on each other)
6. can use both 
	 - older browsers may not support `async` 
	 - will fall back to `defer` behavior




# VIDEO 4 - BROWSER COOKIES


Cookies
- small pieces of info websites store on your computer
- stored and managed by web browser
- included with http requests
	- server sends data to browser, sent back on next req
- websites can only look at their own cookies
- must have server running
	- browsers do not store cookies for the file:// url protocol,

What are cookies used for?
- used to store stateful info about user
	- ex: personal info, browser history, form inputs
	- session cookie for user login/validation
- expire at specified time


"good" cookie uses
- store login state (session token)
- store website preferences
- personalized content (cart, items you view)


"bad" cookie uses
- advertising/tracking networks can track youa cross web
- multiple websites might use trackign scripts from same advertising network



Creating Cookies with Javascript
- `document` interface represents web page loaded in browser
- cookies stored in browser
- thus: can use `document` to get/set cookies


```js
const firstCookie = "myDog=Bodhi";
document.cookie = firstCookie;

const secondCookie = "myOtherDog=Lucy";
document.cookie = secondCookie;

document.cookie //=> "myDog=Bodhi; myOtherDog=Lucy"

```


Deleting Cookies
- set cookie's expiration date to date in past
- can manually delete in chrome dev tools

```js

document.cookie = "myDog=; expires = Thu, 01 Jan 1970 00:00:00 GMT";
document.cookie //=> ""

```

managing your cookies
- can clear cookies but you'll be logged out of sites you use
